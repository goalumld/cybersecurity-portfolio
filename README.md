# About Me
Hello, my name is Andrew and thank you for taking the time to view my cybersecurity portfolio. I am a 7-year Army veteran where I served as an Intelligence Analyst and former full-stack developer who has transitioned into the cybersecurity field. When deciding on a career path, I knew I wanted to work in technology. I began as a full-stack developer after completing a coding bootcamp at Sabio, which led to a position at a startup in Washington. While this role fulfilled my desire to be in tech, I realized I wanted a career where I could make a more meaningful impact. As I explored other paths in the tech industry, I was drawn to cybersecurity. I learned how rapidly cyber threats evolve and how they can cause serious harm to individuals and organizations. That was when I realized I could contribute in a more impactful way by helping protect people and systems from these threats. I began my transition by completing SANS' Applied Cybersecurity Certificate program, earning four GIAC certifications and gaining hands-on experience in the field. Through that journey, I discovered that cybersecurity is exactly the path I had been searching for. I am now pursuing my Bachelor's in Applied Cybersecurity with SANS as I work toward beginning my professional cybersecurity career.

# CTF Experience
- National Cyber League (NCL) Fall 2025 Individual and Team CTF
  Challenges included Scanning and Reconnaisance, Cryptography, Password Cracking, Forensics, and more.
  One key takeaway is that success in cybersecurity relies heavily on teamwork. There were many moments when either I or another team member needed help with a challenge, and someone else stepped in to support and collaborate so the task could be completed effectively.
